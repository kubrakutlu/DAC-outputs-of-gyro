# DAC-outputs-of-gyro
There are 3 text files as the following:

1. config.txt file for DAC models,
2. input.txt file for gyro values of each axes,
3. output.txt file for DAC ouputs (there are 2 DAC models).

main.cpp opens and reads config.txt and input.txt files from the console, it also opens output.txt file to write corresponding DAC ouputs. Sensitivy values and DAC specifications are given inside the code.
